# Grading for Extra Credit 2 on Homework 9

+ ?? /  5: well written description of how you solved the problem

+ ?? / 10: successful execution of appropriately written function such as ``maze_generic ()`` 
           
  The generic puzzle solving function needs to be passed
  arguments to determine the following:

  + way to determine if a final state has been reached
  + way to compute new moves
  + what the starting point is

  If the code works and just one of these is missing, work is
  worth 5 points

  If more than one is missing then work is no points
