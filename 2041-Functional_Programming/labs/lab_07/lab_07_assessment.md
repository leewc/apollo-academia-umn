## Assessment for Lab 7 on code improvement

+ 10 / 10: Appropriate use of multiple patterns in a single clause
in ``freevars``.  Only one example is needed for full credit.

+ 10 / 10: Pattern matching is used appropriately. It is applied to
pairs of values where useful, and ``if-then-else`` expressions are
avoided. 

+ 10 / 10: The ``translate`` function makes just one pass over the
``expr`` input and therefore does not call ``freevars`` or any sort of
"get-type" function.

+ 10 / 10: Descriptive names are used throughout the function
implementations. 

+ 8 / 8: Type annotations are provided on all top-level functions
``freevars``, ``eval``, ``translate``, and ``eval_int_bool``.  Each part of each 
function type is worth 1 point.

+ ___ / 10: Extra Credit: A new version of ``translate``, named
``translate_report_errors``, is implemented following all the
guidelines discussed in this lab and it incorporates the specified
improvements to ``translate``.
